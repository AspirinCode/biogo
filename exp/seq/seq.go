/*
Package seq provides the base for storage and manipulation of biological sequence information.

A variety of sequence types are provided by derived packages including nucleic and protein sequence
with and without quality scores. Multiple sequence data is also supported as unaligned sets and aligned sequences.

Quality scoring is based on Phred scores, although there is the capacity to interconvert between Phred and
Solexa scores and a Solexa quality package is provide, though not integrated.
