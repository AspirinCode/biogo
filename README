BioGo is a library project aiming to provide basic bioinformatics functions for
authoring bioinformatic tools in the Go language.

The intended use cases are for implementing and prototyping where scripting
languages will not provide adequate performance, but time investment in C/C++
cannot be justified.

Basic functionality covers reading and writing FASTA and FASTQ sequence files
and GFF and BED feature files. An extensible lexer is provided to cover I/O for
formats that are not already provided.

Sequence and feature manipulation are available through Seq and Feat objects,
and there is support for interval searching.

Sequence alignment for local alignment of large sequences is supported as is
global alignment via Needleman-Wunsch.

Performance of applications is comparable to C (varying between half the speed
100x faster than equivalent applications depending on implementation details).
Literal translations of BioPerl code can give a 2-order of magnitude
improvement.

At this stage there are minimal docs - some packages are reasonably well
documented, others have only code to go by. Hopefully the style of the code and
the underlying language make up for this in the interim.

There are no tests, although the small suite of example programs do cover a
reasonable amount of the library. I have every intention of fully covering the
library with tests. I plan to use Gustavo Niemeyer's gocheck.
